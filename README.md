# Design-Patterns
These are examples of various design patterns implemented in Java

<b>FIRST DESIGN PATTERN</b>


<h2>Strategy Pattern</h2>
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

The observer Pattern defines one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and are updated.
